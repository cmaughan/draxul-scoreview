# ScoreView — Research on Optimal / Minimum-Time Learning of a Piano Piece

Evidence review feeding the adaptive piano-learning runner (see
[scoreview-manifesto.md](scoreview-manifesto.md)). Produced by **two** deep-research passes
(pass 1: 6 angles → 27 sources → 118 claims; pass 2: focused re-verification of the
sleep / slow-practice / imagery / feedback findings + a dedicated search on hands-separate
practice and backward chaining → 25 sources → 103 claims). Both auto-synthesis steps aborted
on a session limit, so this note is the human-assembled synthesis of the verified + extracted
claim sets. Pass 2 upgraded most Part-1 motor-learning findings from [P] to [V] with exact
statistics and canonical URLs, and filled the Part-2 gaps (hands-separate, backward chaining).

## Confidence legend

- **[V]** — adversarially verified (2–3 independent skeptic votes to keep). Highest confidence.
- **[P]** — quoted from a primary source but *not* adversarially verified (verification queue was cut off). Solid-but-single-checked.
- **[?]** — extracted from a primary source; verification errored before completing. Directional only.

## Bottom line (the highest-leverage findings)

1. **How you practice beats how much you practice.** In the canonical Duke/Simmons piano
   study, retention quality had *no* significant correlation with practice time or number of
   repetitions, but strong correlation with practice *accuracy* and how errors were handled. **[V]**
2. **Errors during practice are corrosive, not neutral.** The single strongest predictor of
   next-day retention was the percentage of *complete* run-throughs played correctly (r = −.71);
   more incorrect trials predicted worse retention. Practising a passage wrong trains the wrong thing. **[V]**
3. **Segment by musical structure, not by fixed windows.** Expert practice starts and stops at
   section/phrase boundaries far more than elsewhere (p < .001), and the piece's formal hierarchy
   becomes the memory-retrieval scheme. Chunk boundaries should map to section/phrase boundaries. **[V]**
4. **The tail of each section is where difficulty lives.** Within a section, later bars are
   repeated more and recalled far worse (recall ≈ .97 at a section's first bar → ≈ .28 at positions
   5–8). Section openings are cheap; interiors/ends need over-scheduling. **[V]**
5. **Interleaving vs. blocked is genuinely contested for real repertoire** — do not treat "always
   interleave" as settled. Lab tasks show a large interleaving retention benefit; applied/musical
   settings show it shrink to near-zero or even reverse. **[V]**
6. **Slow practice and sleep do real work.** Practising *below* target tempo (500 ms/keystroke,
   slower than the player's own max) **doubled** attainable speed over 4 days and held for ~2
   months; overnight sleep *selectively* consolidates a sequence's hardest transition (**+17.8%**,
   P < .001) while barely touching easy ones (**+1.4%**, n.s.). Both now verified with exact stats. **[V]**
7. **Hands-separate practice is effector-specific — it builds each hand but not the integration.**
   Piano speed gains transfer *within* a hand (~1.5×) but **not across hands** (F(1,10)=0.3, p=.60),
   and two-hand sequences are stored as an integrated whole that one-hand practice transfers to only
   ~10%. Use hands-alone to build each hand; train hands-together for the coordinated timing. **[V/P]**
8. **Backward chaining is *not* supported for keyboard — a common piano belief that the data
   contradicts.** The one direct keyboard experiment found it no faster than forward/whole-task and
   *significantly more error-prone* after a week; its parent (ABA) literature finds it merely equal
   to forward chaining, with zero music evidence. Don't default the runner to end-first sequencing. **[P]**

## Part 1 — What makes practice efficient (results per unit time)

### Deliberate practice: necessary, but a weaker raw predictor than folklore claims
- A music-specific meta-analysis (13 studies, N = 788) found a **large** corrected correlation
  between accumulated deliberate practice and musical achievement, **rc = 0.61, 95% CI [0.54, 0.67]**.
  ([Platz et al. 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4073287/)) **[V]**
- But measurement method inflates that link. In the broader Macnamara meta-analysis, studies using
  objective **logs** (what an app actually collects) attributed only **~5% of performance variance
  (r = .22)** to practice quantity, vs. 12% for questionnaires and 20% for interviews. Self-reported
  practice hours overstate the effect.
  ([Macnamara et al. 2014](https://hhs.purdue.edu/skill-learning-and-performance-lab/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/08/macnamara-et-al-2014-deliberate-practice-and-performance-in-music-games-sports-education-and-professions-a-meta-analysis.pdf)) **[P]**
- **Takeaway:** hours are a floor, not the lever. The lever is what happens inside the hour.

### Quality of practice (the Duke, Simmons & Cash 2009 study — the direct answer to "what do efficient practicers do")
17 advanced piano majors learned a hard 3-bar Shostakovich passage to a fixed target tempo, tested next day. ([Duke, Simmons & Cash 2009, JRME](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022429408328851))
- **No** significant relationship between retention and practice time, total trials, or complete trials. **[V]**
- **Strong** relationships with *how* they practiced (rankings ordered best-first, so negative r = better):
  - % of all trials correct: **r = −.51**
  - % of *complete* run-throughs correct: **r = −.71** (strongest single predictor)
  - number of incorrect trials during practice: **r = +.48** (more errors → worse retention) **[V]**
- Conclusion in the authors' words: strategies "were more determinative of performance quality at
  retention than was how much or how long the pianists practiced." **[V]**
- What the top practicers actually did (from this and the related Duke corpus): played *slowly enough
  to be accurate*, isolated the exact hard spot rather than restarting from the top, corrected errors
  immediately and didn't play past them, and repeated the *corrected* version — not the whole passage.

### Interleaving / contextual interference — real, but weaker for music than the textbooks imply
This is the most nuanced area; the evidence genuinely splits.
- **Classic CI paradox (motor tasks):** random/interleaved practice hurts *during acquisition* but
  helps *retention and transfer*. ([2024 meta-analysis, Nature Sci Rep](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-65753-3)) **[V]**
- **But the benefit is context-dependent:** that same meta-analysis found the retention benefit
  **large in lab tasks (SMD ≈ 0.92)** yet **negligible and non-significant in applied settings
  (SMD ≈ 0.23, p = .24)**. Learning a real piece is an applied setting. **[V]**
- **Music evidence disagrees with itself:**
  - *For* interleaving: 10 clarinetists in an ecological context — interleaved pieces rated better
    than blocked whenever ratings differed. ([Carter & Grahn 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4989027/)) **[V]**
  - *Against* interleaving: 20 advanced violinists — no acquisition difference, and at 24-hour
    retention the **blocked** schedule was *best*. ([Mathias & Goldman 2025, JRME](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00224294231222801)) **[V]**
  - Serial-RT lab work lands pro-interleaving: interleaved trainees improved overnight while blocked
    trainees got worse, and interleaving transferred to novel sequences regardless of test order.
    ([PMC8476370](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8476370/)) **[V]**
- **Acquisition ≠ retention.** The strategy that maximizes *in-session* fluency is not necessarily
  the one that maximizes durable skill. Do not tune scheduling to same-session gains. **[V]**
- **The fluency trap:** learners prefer blocked practice because repetition *feels* fluent, even
  though the harder-feeling schedule often retains better. An app should expect users to resist
  interleaving and may need to nudge. **[P]**
- **Design reading for ScoreView:** interleave *across* chunks/pieces (revisit earlier chunks, don't
  drill one to death), but don't over-randomize a single hard passage — for one passage, correct
  repetition dominates. This straddles the split evidence rather than betting the disputed direction.

### Spacing / distributed practice — real over days, unreliable over minutes
- **Over long horizons:** the optimal gap between sessions **grows with how long you need to retain**
  the material (nonmonotonic lag effect): sub-minute gaps for sub-minute retention; ~1-month gaps for
  6-month retention. ([Cepeda et al. 2006 meta-analysis](https://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Cepeda2006.pdf)) **[V]**
- **Over short horizons:** inserting 1/5/10/15-minute gaps between two piano sessions produced **no**
  spacing benefit over massed practice — because no forgetting occurred in the gap.
  ([Piano novice study, PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182986)) **[P]**
- **Expanding schedules** (progressively widening review gaps) beat fixed intervals across 18 studies,
  but the evidence is weak (large SEs). **[P]**
- **Design reading:** schedule review of a mastered chunk *across days/sessions with widening gaps*,
  not within a single sitting. Space to induce a little forgetting, then retrieve.

### Slow practice / tempo ramping — verified, with hard numbers
- Four days practising a 12-note sequence at a **fixed submaximal** tempo (500 ms inter-keystroke
  interval — significantly slower than participants' own pre-practice max of 345 ± 54 ms) **doubled**
  attainable maximum speed (session×group F(7,70)=13.7, p=5×10⁻¹¹), and slow practice alone was
  *sufficient* to raise the ceiling. ([BMC Neuroscience 2013, 14:133](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2202-14-133) · [PMC4228459](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4228459/)) **[V]**
- The doubled speed **persisted ~2 months** with no intervening practice (Day-4 vs 2-month: paired
  t(5)=−1.73, p=0.14, i.e. no significant decline). **[V]**
- Gains were **effector-specific** — they transferred *within* the trained hand (untrained sequence
  ~1.5× faster) but **not across** to the other hand (see Hands-separate, Part 2). **[V]**
- **Design reading:** a "start slow, ramp tempo only when accuracy gates are met" loop is
  evidence-backed. Speed is an *output* of accurate slow reps, not something to chase directly.

### Mental practice / motor imagery — genuine, engages motor circuits, best when varied
- Mental practice recruits real motor circuitry: fMRI of 12 pianists imagining vs. playing a Bartók
  passage found **both** engaged a bilateral fronto-parietal/premotor network (precuneus, medial
  BA40) — but primary motor cortex fired **only during actual playing**. Imagery trains *planning*,
  not execution. ([Meister et al. 2004, *Cogn. Brain Res.*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926641004000023)) **[V]**
- The canonical piano five-finger study (Pascual-Leone et al. 1995, TMS) compared *mental* vs
  *physical* practice of the same exercise; physical practice measurably enlarged the finger muscles'
  cortical maps. ([PMID 7500130](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7500130/)) **[V]**
  *(The oft-repeated "imagery produced identical cortical reorganization" claim could **not** be
  corroborated from the accessible abstract — treat that stronger version as unverified.)*
- **Variable** motor-imagery practice produced further gains *after a night's sleep* and best transfer
  to novel sequences; **constant/repetitive** imagery produced no delayed gains. Vary the mentally
  rehearsed order. ([PMID 25562401](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25562401/) · review [PMC4923126](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4923126/)) **[V]**

### Sleep / consolidation — verified; treat overnight as part of the learning curve
- Overnight sleep yields large speed gains with **no** extra practice (unimanual-5 **+17.7%**,
  t(14)=6.23, P<0.0001; up to **+28.9%** for the complex bimanual-9 task), whereas an equal ~8-hour
  span of daytime **wake yields +0.9%** (t(13)=0.35, P=0.72) and slight accuracy *decline*. Harder/
  denser sequences gain *more*. ([Kuriyama, Stickgold & Walker 2004, *Learn. Mem.* 11(6):705](https://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/11/6/705.full) · [PMC534699](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC534699/); orig. [Walker et al. 2002, *Neuron*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627302007468), ~20% overnight) **[V]**
- Sleep is **selective**: it preferentially resolves a sequence's slowest, hardest transition
  ("problem point", **+17.8%**, P<0.001) while barely improving easy transitions (**+1.4%**, n.s.);
  the dissociation is significant (ANOVA F(1,53)=19.8, P<0.0001) and does **not** appear during
  waking training. **[V]**
- **Design reading:** identify each piece's "problem-point" junctions; expect them to improve after
  sleep even without more reps. Don't expect all improvement within one session; schedule a re-test
  *after* a night rather than grinding the same night.

## Part 2 — How to break a piece into teachable units

### Whole vs. part vs. whole-part-whole
- The decision is driven by **task complexity and organization** (Naylor–Briggs) or skill
  classification (Schmidt–Wrisberg): use **whole** practice when sub-parts are highly *interdependent*
  (high organization) and the task isn't too complex; use **part** practice when the task is complex
  but its parts are relatively *independent*. A meta-analysis found effect sizes generally support
  these textbook rules. ([Fontana et al. 2009, whole/part meta-analysis](https://scholarworks.uni.edu/facpub/2208/)) **[V]**
- Music maps naturally onto this: a piece is complex (favouring parts) but a phrase is internally
  interdependent (favouring whole-phrase practice) — hence **phrase-sized chunks, practised whole,
  then reassembled** is the theory-consistent unit.

### Chunk boundaries should follow musical structure
- Expert practice segments **begin and end at formal section boundaries** significantly more than at
  other bars (p < .001 across learning periods). ([Chaffin 2002, *Practicing Perfection*](https://production.wordpress.uconn.edu/musiclab/wp-content/uploads/sites/290/2013/10/Practicing-Perfection-Chaffin-2002.pdf)) **[V]**
- The piece is learned as a **hierarchy** (movement → section → subsection → bar), and that structure
  *is* the retrieval scheme — structural position predicted unaided recall two years later
  (R² = .76). Not an undifferentiated motor stream. **[V]**
- **Section-opening bars act as privileged retrieval cues**: advanced pianists recognized the first
  bar of a section significantly faster (~1010 ms, 89.9% accurate) than interior bars.
  ([Williamon & Egner 2004](http://www.brainmusic.org/EducationalActivities/Williamon_memory2004.pdf)) **[V]**
- **Design reading:** ScoreView should parse a piece into nested musical structure and make chunk
  boundaries = phrase/section boundaries, with section openings as "anchor" checkpoints.

### Serial position: over-schedule the interior/tail of each chunk
- Later bars in a section are repeated more (harder to learn) and recalled far worse (≈ .97 → ≈ .28
  across positions). Memory hesitations concentrate at section ends and designated cue points — and
  these are *predictable in advance*. **[V]**
- **Design reading:** front of a chunk is cheap; weight repetition and feedback toward the *back half*
  of each chunk and the *seams between chunks*.

### Difficulty-based prioritization
- Professional pianists isolate the hardest passages and **drill them repeatedly at slow tempo before
  moving on**. Difficulty-first + slow-repetition is a reported expert strategy. **[?]**
- Consistent with sleep's selective consolidation of "problem points" — the hard junctions are exactly
  what deserve isolation *and* an overnight window.

### Chunking mechanics (and a genre caveat)
- Skill acquisition moves from element-by-element execution toward holistic "Gestalt" processing by
  grouping into meaningful chunks. ([review, PMC10883160](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10883160/)) **[P]**
- In **tonal** music chunks are conceptual/harmonic groupings; in **atonal/contemporary** repertoire
  they're often **physical hand-shapes / intervallic models** instead. Segmentation logic may need to
  differ by idiom. **[?]**
- Incremental ("add elements as you go") vs. global ("whole sequence every session") strategies engage
  a shared striatal/fronto-parietal network; global additionally recruits cerebellar + hippocampal
  regions — the two approaches are neurally distinct, not interchangeable.
  ([PMC4141721](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4141721/)) **[P/?]**

### Hands-separate vs. hands-together (pass-2 dedicated search)
The honest answer: **there is almost no direct experimental test in *piano*** — the standard
hands-separate-first ("part-whole") method is the acknowledged incumbent but rests on qualitative
pedagogy, not data ([Frontiers 2023, 14:1124508](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1124508/full), which itself says "empirical evidence is needed"). **[P]**
What the motor-learning literature *does* establish:
- **Motor-sequence learning is effector-specific.** Piano finger-speed gains transferred within the
  trained hand but **not** to the untrained hand (inter-manual F(1,10)=0.3, p=0.60; intra > inter,
  F(1,10)=6.5, p=0.03). Training one hand does not raise the other. ([BMC Neurosci 2013, 14:133](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2202-14-133)) **[V]**
- **Two-hand sequences are stored as an integrated whole, not two glued-together parts.** With no
  cues there was *no* significant transfer between unimanual and bimanual finger sequences either
  direction (uni→bi F(2,14)=0.27, P=0.77); even with explicit cues, transfer stayed ~10% (vs >50% for
  force-field learning). First-day gains were larger unimanual (54%) than bimanual (27%), and bimanual
  baselines were 2× slower. ([PMC10224868](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10224868/)) **[P]**
- **Learned key/chord skill is bound to the hand posture used** — practised chords slowed 566→658 ms
  when the hand configuration changed (F(1,30)=36.91, p<.001, ηp²=0.55); skill is stored as hand
  postures, and bimanual practice builds *separate per-hand postures executed simultaneously*.
  Splitting keys across two hands also *reduces* inter-finger interference (505 vs 621 ms).
  ([PMC5338615](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5338615/)) **[P]**
- **Counter-current — the *coordination pattern* can transfer.** For a learned 90° bimanual rhythmic
  coordination, training transferred between one- and two-hand configurations (equal once scaled by
  intrinsic stability), because learning a coordination is "primarily perceptual." ([PMID 25929551](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25929551)) **[P]**
- **Reconciled reading:** hands-separate is useful for *building each hand's execution and posture*
  and for *lowering load* on hard passages — but the *sequence-specific memory and the between-hand
  integration/timing do not come for free from separate practice* and must be trained hands-together.
  This matches the whole/part rule (Part 2, above): the two hands of an interdependent passage are
  "high-organization" → practise the integration whole.

### Backward chaining & segment ordering (pass-2 dedicated search)
Backward chaining (learn the last segment first, add earlier ones) is popular piano-teaching folklore
("you're always playing *into* familiar territory"). The evidence does **not** support it as a
proficiency win:
- **Origin is behavior-analytic (ABA)**, for teaching multi-step *functional* tasks (dressing,
  tooth-brushing) to people with developmental disabilities — **no music/keyboard application**, and
  the canonical comparison (Slocum & Tiger 2011, *JABA* 44(4):793–805) plus the ABA consensus find
  **no conclusive advantage** over forward chaining; both are "effective." ([ABA overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_chaining_(applied_behavior_analysis))) **[P]**
- **The one direct keyboard experiment** (N=36, 9-key discrete-sequence task, immediate + 1-week
  retention) found **no** significant speed difference between backward / forward / whole-task
  (F(2,33)=1.85, p=.17; means numerically *favoured* whole-task 300 ms & forward 330 ms over backward
  350 ms) — and backward chaining was **significantly more error-prone after a week** at two key
  locations (F(2,33)=5.05, p=.012, ηp²=.23; and p=.009, ηp²=.25). The authors: backward chaining
  *distorts the natural serial order*, adding a reassembly cost. ([Utwente thesis 2022](https://essay.utwente.nl/87692/1/Schneider_BA_BMS.pdf); corroborated by Watters 1990/1992 keying-sequence work) **[P]**
- **Where backward *did* win**, it was only *acquisition speed* on a novel assembly task with **no
  retention benefit** (Am J Occup Ther 1978); and on the *hardest* assembly chains, **forward** was
  more efficient (~20-trial gap) — difficulty/novelty drove the difference, not a general backward
  advantage. ([PMID 676946](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/676946/); Lego/chess ABA study, [Northeastern](https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:513/fulltext.pdf)) **[P]**
- **Reading:** don't default the runner to end-first sequencing. Forward or whole-phrase practice with
  *difficulty-first isolation* of hard spots is at least as good and less error-prone. Backward
  chaining's only defensible niche is motivational/confidence ("always finishing on solid ground"),
  which is not an accuracy or speed win in the data.

---

## Part 3 — What efficient practicers measurably do differently
(Consolidated from Duke/Simmons, Chaffin, Williamon, and the pro-pianist interview study.)

- **Accuracy over volume** — they maximize the proportion of *correct complete* run-throughs, not the
  count of run-throughs. **[V]**
- **Immediate, localized error correction** — they stop at the error, fix it, and repeat the corrected
  fragment rather than playing on. Uncorrected errors predicted worse retention. **[V]**
- **Structure-anchored practice** — they start/stop at section boundaries; as expertise grows,
  practice increasingly starts on *structural* bars and less on merely *difficult* bars (structure
  becomes the retrieval scaffold). **[V for boundaries; ? for the expertise-shift]**
- **Deliberate mental preparation** — more experienced players spend as long imagining the target as
  performing it before they play. **[P]**
- **Difficulty triage** — they identify the few hardest passages and give them disproportionate, slow,
  isolated practice. **[?]**

---

## Part 4 — Feedback & adaptive software (direct evidence for ScoreView)

- **Augmented feedback works, with a large effect — but the headline study is on violinists.** A
  4-month quasi-experiment on the commercial AI app *Violy* (real-time error detection + automated
  scoring) beat traditional practice by **d = 1.01** (+3.1 pts, 95% CI [1.62, 4.58], F(1,72.2)=17.35,
  p<.001) and raised self-efficacy (Group×Time η²p = 0.349, F(1,38)=20.38, p<.001), scaffolding a full
  self-regulated-learning loop (forethought → real-time monitoring → self-reflection). **Caveats:**
  N = 40 **violinists** (not pianists), non-randomised; *Violy* does also support piano, so the
  platform type transfers even if the sample doesn't. ([Frontiers in Psychology 2025](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1675762/full)) **[P]**
- **Visual > audio feedback for technique** (verified in direction by pass 2). Trial-by-trial *visual*
  feedback of movement discrepancy vs. a prize-winning expert let trained pianists refine performance
  where **conventional auditory learning did not**; it induced richer *movement exploration* (the
  proposed plateau-breaking mechanism) and produced perceptible sound-quality gains judged by expert
  pianists. (Pass-1 extraction gave the magnitudes: visual Δ≈0.141 with CI above zero vs. audio
  Δ≈0.038 with CI spanning zero; blind listeners 53.2% vs 44.0% judged closer to target.) **Caveat:**
  frequent/simple feedback can be *useless or harmful* for experts — feedback must add information the
  player can't already perceive. ([bioRxiv 2025, 683818](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.23.683818v1.full)) **[P]**
- **Give the target model up front** (corroborated by pass 2). Musicians who heard a correct auditory
  model of the melody *before* practising made significantly larger gains **both** during training and
  across the overnight interval than a no-model control — a cheap, high-leverage move (10 reps at fixed
  tempo before hands-on, n ≈ 32). ([JRME, doi 0022429413520409](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022429413520409)) **[P]**
- **Adaptive task selection is being done with RL.** A Deep Q-Network agent that ingests
  multi-dimensional performance metrics (technical proficiency, expressiveness, sight-reading,
  interpretation) to pick next tasks + personalize feedback is a concrete design pattern.
  ([PeerJ CS 2025](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-3464/)) **[P]**
- **Gamification helps engagement/knowledge** (children, 8-week module, r = 0.87 on a music-knowledge
  test, and *more uniform* outcomes) — but that outcome was written theory, **not** motor
  proficiency/timing/accuracy. Don't over-read it as evidence for technical skill.

## Design implications for ScoreView (synthesis)

1. **Parse to musical structure first.** Represent a piece as movement → section → phrase → bar and
   make every practice chunk a phrase/section unit. Never chunk by fixed note-count windows. (Ch.
   3–4, Part 2.)
2. **Anchor on section openings, over-weight section tails.** Use first-bars-of-sections as
   checkpoints/anchors; schedule extra reps + feedback on the back half of chunks and the seams
   between them.
3. **Accuracy-gated tempo ramp.** Hold tempo low until the learner plays *complete correct*
   run-throughs of a chunk; only then raise tempo. Track "% complete-correct," the strongest retention
   predictor — not total attempts.
4. **Don't reward playing-through-errors.** Detect errors and steer the learner back to fix-and-repeat
   the corrected fragment; a run with an uncorrected error should count *against*, not toward, mastery.
5. **Interleave across chunks, correct-repeat within a hard chunk.** Rotate among chunks/pieces and
   revisit earlier material (spacing + mild interleaving), but for one hard passage prioritize correct
   repetition over randomization — matching where the music evidence actually agrees.
6. **Space reviews across sessions with widening gaps**, not within a sitting. Schedule a mastered
   chunk to resurface tomorrow, then later, expanding the interval.
7. **Treat sleep as a stage.** Re-test after an overnight gap; expect "problem-point" junctions to
   improve without more reps. Surface this to the user ("come back tomorrow — the hard bar will feel
   easier") rather than encouraging one-session grinding.
8. **Feedback: visual, target-relative, segment-level.** Show discrepancy vs. a target model per
   chunk and per run; present the goal (audio/animation) *before* the chunk. Keep feedback
   informative (what to change), and dial it back as a player nears mastery of a chunk.
9. **Adapt task selection on multi-dimensional state** (accuracy, timing, tempo reached, error
   locations) — an RL/bandit selector fits the "endless runner" framing.
10. **Beware the fluency trap.** Users will *prefer* easy blocked repetition that feels fluent but
    retains poorly. The runner should sometimes make them do the harder-but-better thing.
11. **Hands-separate is a load-reducer, not a substitute for integration.** Offer hands-alone practice
    to build each hand's posture/speed and to de-load hard passages — but because learning is
    effector-specific and two-hand skill is stored as an integrated whole, *require* hands-together
    reps to train the coordination/timing. Don't mark a passage mastered on hands-separate evidence
    alone. Track per-hand *and* combined accuracy separately.
12. **Sequence chunks forward / whole-phrase, not backward.** The evidence contradicts backward
    chaining for keyboard (more error-prone after consolidation). Default to forward or whole-phrase
    practice with **difficulty-first isolation** of the hard spots; reserve any end-first ordering for
    optional motivational "finish strong" framing, not as the core learning path.

## Caveats & what to research next

- Much of the "how-to-practice" gold (Duke/Simmons, Chaffin, Williamon) rests on **small N** and, for
  Chaffin, an **N = 1 expert case study** (corroborated by cited multi-subject work). Directionally
  strong, precisely calibrated less so.
- The **interleaving** question is genuinely unresolved for real repertoire — resist a hard "always
  interleave" rule in the product.
- **Sleep, slow-practice, and motor-imagery** findings were re-verified in pass 2 with exact stats and
  canonical URLs (now [V]). The **feedback/software** results remain [P]: the headline app study is on
  *violinists* (not pianists) and non-randomised, and the visual-vs-audio magnitudes come from a 2025
  *preprint* — both worth watching for peer-reviewed piano replication.
- **Hands-separate** and **backward chaining** are now covered (pass 2), but note their piano-specific
  evidence is thin: the strongest hands/bimanual results are lab finger-sequence tasks, and the direct
  backward-chaining keyboard test is a small undergraduate thesis. Directionally clear, not definitive.
- **Still open:** the optimal *number* of reps per session; how much a chunk's difficulty should scale
  its scheduled repetition; and whether these lab effects hold for full pieces over weeks, not
  single sessions.
