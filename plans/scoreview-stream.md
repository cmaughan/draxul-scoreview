# ScoreView milestone 5: the stream (dynamic music + player memory)

The manifesto's heart, specified by the user 2026-07-13: show a short
rolling window of music (~2 bars visible, configurable) and **dynamically
append music to its end**. Understand the piece up front (key, chords and
their neighborings, motifs, rhythm figures). Then, as the runner rolls,
**write music** — subtly melodic, in the piece's own language — that
repeats the phrases, components, notes, and *timings* the player is
demonstrably struggling with. Persist everything between sessions (JSON):
notes succeeded, notes missed, chords in trouble, and — very important —
timing tendencies (e.g. triplets consistently played slow must be
detected, drilled, and fixed). The stream converges on the actual piece
— beginning, middle, end, sliced and rearranged — **only as the player
improves**: convergence is gated on demonstrated mastery, never on
elapsed time. How long that takes varies per player and per piece; a
session (or many) may never reach the full performance, and that's
correct behavior — the problems get drilled until they're consistently
right, and *getting* to the whole piece is the goal, not the schedule.

## S0 — Player memory: timing capture + the progress store ✅ (2026-07-13)

The foundation; valuable before any generation exists (today's full-piece
roll already produces the data).

- **Timing capture in Roll**: on every hit record `delta_q = position_q −
  onset_q` (negative = early), in beats so it's tempo-independent. Add a
  timing-quality weight to the accuracy sample (center of window = 1.0,
  edges taper) so "hit but badly late" stops counting as perfect — this
  is what lets the tempo controller and the drills *feel* timing.
- **Verdict provenance**: every judged note maps to a source reference —
  for now `piece qstamp + element id`; once generation exists, drills
  carry `(kind, source_ref)` provenance so a missed drill note still
  debits the right piece location/skill.
- **`PlayerModel`** (in-memory aggregates, pure + unit-testable):
  per-pitch hit/miss/wrong-near counts; per-piece-onset attempts/hits/
  timing mean+variance; per-chord (sorted pitch multiset) hit/miss/split
  counts (split = chord notes judged apart in time); per-rhythm-figure
  timing drift (see S1 figures); per-bar mastery score in [0,1] (decayed
  blend of accuracy × timing quality); session records; best/last tempo.
- **Persistence**: versioned JSON, one file per piece keyed by source
  content hash: `<user-data>/scoreview/progress/<hash>.json` (same root
  the config machinery already resolves; atomic tmp+rename writes).
  Flushed at bar boundaries and on shutdown; loaded at startup — the
  session resumes at a tempo informed by history, and the generator
  knows day-one what needed work yesterday.
Shipped: `NoteOutcome`/`ChordOutcome` streams from the FlowController
(hit delta + center-weighted quality feeding the accuracy EMA;
edge-quality floor `kRollEdgeQuality`; chord clean/split/miss at window
close with `kChordSplitQ`), `PlayerModel` aggregates (Welford timing,
per-onset recent-encounter rings, near-miss stray attribution, bar
mastery = recent-mean), `progress_store` (FNV-1a piece hash, tmp+rename
atomic writes), host wiring (load at open, resume tempo from last
session, flush per bar + session end). Verified live: two consecutive
runs — save then load then extend — with the Grieg's real LH chords in
the file. Figure-level drift lands with S1's rhythm figures.

- **Schema sketch** (all fields versioned, unknown fields preserved):

  ```json
  {
    "version": 1,
    "piece": { "title": "Walz", "hash": "…", "marking_qpm": 130 },
    "tempo": { "best_frac": 0.82, "last_frac": 0.74 },
    "sessions": [ { "start": "…", "seconds": 1840, "notes": 612 } ],
    "pitch": { "60": { "hit": 41, "miss": 3, "wrong_near": 2,
                        "dt_mean_q": -0.06, "dt_var_q": 0.01 } },
    "onset": { "12.5": { "hit": 4, "miss": 2, "dt_mean_q": 0.11 } },
    "chord": { "48+64+67": { "hit": 4, "miss": 6, "split": 3 } },
    "figure": { "triplet_8": { "seen": 12, "drift_q": -0.18 } },
    "bar_mastery": { "1": 0.9, "2": 0.4 }
  }
  ```

## S1 — Piece analysis (`PieceProfile`, computed at load) ✅ (2026-07-13)

Shipped: `analyze_piece()` (pure, from the judgment axis — onset qstamps +
pitches), profile cached on the host and dumped beside the progress file
as `<hash>.analysis.json`. On the Grieg it finds A minor globally with
the A major episode and the A major (picardy) ending in the section list,
a 15-chord vocabulary whose top transitions read like functional analysis
(B halfdim7 → E maj → A; E aug → A min), the waltz's 12 triplet beats and
its grace-note figures ("0,1"), and the main theme's contour among 8
recurring motifs. Six unit cases incl. the real piece.

All from the semantic model + timemap; pure, unit-tested against the
Grieg (known answers) and synthetic fixtures.

- **Key estimate**: Krumhansl–Schmuckler correlation of the pitch-class
  histogram against major/minor profiles, with the notated signature
  (fifths) as a prior; windowed per 8 bars to catch modulations. Output:
  global key + per-section keys with confidence.
- **Chord inventory + "nearings"**: cluster near-simultaneous pitches at
  each onset into vertical sonorities; classify by pitch-class set
  (triads/sevenths, inversion); record each chord's *contexts* — the
  chords before and after it (a bigram transition table), its bar
  positions, and its hand split. This is the generator's harmonic
  vocabulary AND its join table (what legally follows what).
- **Motif mining**: n-grams (3–8 notes) over the top voice by interval +
  rhythm shape; keep recurring ones with counts and locations. The LH
  accompaniment figure (the waltz oom-pah-pah) is detected the same way
  on the bottom staff — it becomes the default accompaniment template.
- **Rhythm figures**: the piece's distinct duration patterns per beat
  span (dotted pairs, triplets, straight eighths…), each with its
  canonical grid — the *timing drill targets* that S0's drift statistics
  key on.

## S2 — The rolling window (display + append machinery) ✅ (2026-07-13)

Shipped: `SourceSlicer` re-emits any bar range as a self-contained
document (original measures verbatim, accumulated attribute state
injected at the window head) — proven ENGRAVE-EQUIVALENT to the monolith
on the real Grieg (every onset in bars 10–17 matches qstamp-shifted with
identical pitches). Roll mode plays on a 10-bar window (1 history + 8
ahead) rebuilt one bar at a time as the playhead crosses the history
margin: `FlowController` carry APIs (`carry_state`/`restore_carry`,
`preset_verdict`, `fast_forward_resolved`) move tempo/score/accuracy and
repaint earned verdicts onto each fresh engraving from the host's verdict
archive; outcomes land in the player model on the stream axis. The view
now sizes by WIDTH — ~2 bars around the playhead fill the pane (zoom
divides the bar count) — and `r` restarts the stream. Verified live:
seven window swaps in 25 s (~80 ms each, logged; async double-buffer is
the recorded optimization follow-up), red verdicts surviving every swap,
misses accumulating across windows. Clock flow and Gate mode keep the
monolithic strip (the bots' world); `.mxl` sources fall back likewise.

Replaces "engrave the whole piece once" with a window that can change
while playing — the enabling mechanics for everything else.

- **Window document**: `visible_bars` (config `[score] window_bars`,
  default 2) + `lookahead_bars` (default 6) model measures. A minimal
  **MusicXML writer** for our generated vocabulary (notes, chords,
  rests, ties, dots, tuplets, key/time/clefs) feeds Verovio — the exact
  inverse of the importer subset, golden-file round-trip tested
  (write → Verovio load → timemap/pitches match the model).
- **Swap at bar boundaries**: when the playhead crosses into bar k+1,
  build the next window (drop head, append tail), engrave, re-join the
  timemap, and **re-base**: window-local qstamps ↔ stream qstamps via a
  running offset; transport position, verdict states of still-visible
  notes, lit set, and metronome bar phase all carry over. Departed bars'
  verdicts flush into the PlayerModel as they scroll off.
- **Continuity rules**: never re-engrave content at or left of the
  playhead; swap only affects the tail. Engraving ~8 bars is fast; do it
  synchronously at the boundary first, move to a worker double-buffer
  only if a frame hitch is measurable (log the engrave time).
- **Proof**: passthrough mode — the window walks the actual piece
  unchanged. Acceptance: a full Grieg roll via the window produces the
  same onset sequence and verdicts as the monolithic strip (log/diff
  verification), with screenshots across several swaps showing no visual
  discontinuity at the playhead.

## S3 — The composer (generation v1) ✅ core shipped (2026-07-13)

Shipped: `StreamComposer` plans the stream program slot by slot from the
LIVE player model — piece bars at a walking frontier, spaced REVIEW
slices of weak encountered bars (mastery < 0.5, per-bar caps), and
fabricated chord-DRILL bars built from the exact voiced pitches in
trouble (miss+split ≥ 3 outweighing clean, per-chord cooldown, ≥2 piece
bars between specials — never boring). Drills are written as MusicXML
measures (repeated upper grab over a held bass, in the reference bar's
divisions/meter) and flow through `SourceSlicer::window_xml_for()` —
arbitrary sequences of verbatim source bars and fabricated measures,
proven to engrave (unit test asserts the drill's onsets pixel-true
through Verovio). Provenance: review outcomes train the SOURCE bar's
statistics; drill outcomes carry an onset sentinel and train pitch/chord
stats only — never bar mastery. Verified live: an all-miss seed session
followed by a fresh run produced `stream: slot 2 = drill chord 52+60 (12
trouble)` (+3 more, spaced), the drill bar visibly engraved mid-stream,
and the pill shows DRILL/REVIEW while inside one. Single-part sources
only (grand staff = one part); multi-part streams stay verbatim.
Remaining for S3 polish (fold into S4): melodic/motif drills, rhythm
figure drills keyed to timing drift, key-aware transposition variation,
and drills earning their retirement (trouble decays as clean grabs land).

Decoupled (2026-07-16, kanban 20 scoreview-composer-decoupling): the
composer now extends a host-owned `StreamProgram` (slot geometry + the
`source_at` provenance query both hand-rolled host mappings collapsed
into), emits measures through the shared `measure_xml` writer, and sits
behind the `IComposer` seam (`supports()` owns the single-part gate) —
all in the `draxul-score-learn` leaf library, so alternative composers
(rewriters, modifiers) plug in without touching the host. The program
is append-only behind the engrave frontier; a rewriting composer may
re-plan only the open future.

`StreamComposer`: given PieceProfile + PlayerModel + transport state,
emit the next bar as model measures with per-note provenance. The
string-vs-semantic fabrication decision is recorded in
plans/scoreview-composition-model.md (semantic on per-note-provenance
adoption; strings until then, golden-XML guarded).

- **Sources on a mastery ladder** (weakest-first, spaced-repetition
  style): (a) *piece bars* at the current frontier; (b) *hands-separate*
  or *simplified* piece bars (strip inner voices/ornaments) when a bar's
  mastery is low; (c) *fabricated drills* for the weakest items:
  - chord-pair alternation for fumbled transitions (from the bigram
    table, so it's the piece's own progression);
  - rhythm drills: a struggling figure (e.g. those slow triplets) first
    on one repeated pitch, then on the motif that carries it;
  - motif repetition with subtle in-key variation (transpose within the
    key, neighbor tones, step-preferring contour, chord tones on strong
    beats) — the "slightly melodic" requirement;
  - problem-note spotlights: the missed pitch embedded in short scale/
    arpeggio fragments from the piece's key.
- **Joins**: bars connect through the transition table (end a drill on a
  sonority that legally leads to the next bar's opening); keep the LH
  template running underneath RH drills so everything sounds like the
  piece, not like an exercise book.
- **Anti-boredom constraints**: never the same drill more than twice in
  a row; interleave a mastered "victory lap" bar regularly; drill
  probability ∝ weakness but capped.
- **Every generated note carries provenance** so its verdict feeds the
  right statistic — the loop that makes the lesson adaptive.

## S4 — Convergence and slicing (mastery-gated, never time-gated)
### ✅ core shipped (2026-07-13): the simplification ladder + the arc

Shipped, per the user's direction that the composer must SIMPLIFY, not
just repeat:

- **Hands separate**: the worst deeply-struggling bar (recent mastery <
  0.3) returns with its weak hand alone — the real measure with the
  other staff surgically removed (`SourceSlicer::hands_separate_xml`,
  cursor-move cleanup proven by engraving), weak hand chosen by summed
  per-pitch miss rates per staff. Once per bar per program.
- **Chord ladder**: drills now start BROKEN (arpeggiated eighths landing
  on the block grab) and climb to the block form on later encounters;
  trouble is net of clean grabs (miss + split − clean), so drills retire
  themselves as the player fixes the chord.
- **Scale fragments**: an octave register accumulating misses (≥5,
  misses > hits) earns a one-bar scale run through that register in the
  piece's key (S1's estimate; natural minor v1).
- **Rotation**: the special chain (hands → drill → scale → review)
  rotates its starting point per special so twenty weak bars cannot
  starve the chord drills — verified live: hands / broken drill / scale
  / review cycling every third bar against seeded trouble.
- **The convergence arc**: when the frontier finishes the piece the
  stream does NOT end — it loops through the weakest kSliceBars-long
  slice (unencountered bars count as zero) until EVERY bar is
  encountered and promoted (recent mastery ≥ 0.7), then schedules the
  full performance run ("performance run — every bar mastered") and
  only then finishes. Unit-proven with a virtual session against the
  real Grieg geometry.

Remaining S4 increments: rhythm-figure drills keyed to per-figure timing
drift (the "triplets consistently slow" mechanic — S0 records the deltas,
S1 knows the figure locations; the fabricator + drift detector are the
missing joints), LH-reduced (not removed) accompaniment variants,
harmonic/melodic-minor scale choice, weakness-profiled roll bots for
long-session verification, and the R2 feel pass with the user.



- The **frontier roams**: practice segments picked from the beginning,
  middle, and end of the piece (weighted by mastery), so the piece is
  learned as slices that grow and merge — the user's "from the end, from
  the beginning, from the middle, sliced up".
- **Promotion is earned, not scheduled**: drill share decays, real-piece
  runs lengthen, and the tempo target climbs only when the mastery map
  crosses explicit thresholds (accuracy AND timing consistency per
  bar/figure, sustained over repeated encounters — not a lucky pass).
  Nothing promotes because time passed; a struggling player gets more
  drilling, not the piece anyway. The full start-to-finish performance
  happens only when every slice has earned it — that run IS the
  milestone's acceptance test, whenever it comes.
- Session pacing: fatigue guard (drill density eases late in a long
  session), and the JSON's session records let tomorrow start exactly
  where mastery says, not where the clock left off.

## Verification instruments

- **Weakness-profiled bot**: extend the bot family with per-pitch/figure
  error and timing-skew profiles (deterministic seed). Acceptance: a bot
  that rushes triplets and fumbles one chord must, within N bars, be
  served triplet drills and that chord's alternation drill (log lines:
  `stream: drill <kind> reason <stat>`), and its stats must visibly
  improve the mastery numbers when the profile is corrected.
- Golden-file tests for the MusicXML writer and the JSON schema
  (round-trip, version migration, unknown-field preservation).
- Long-run soak: bot plays 30+ minutes through the window; no drift
  between transport, metronome bar phase, and engraved bars (assert via
  periodic log sampling).

## Order & risks

S0 → S1 → S2 → S3 → S4; each lands green before the next starts (the
established per-phase commit pattern). Risks called out up front:
re-engrave spacing shifts right of the playhead (accepted; anchored at
the playhead), repeats/non-monotonic onsets (window sidesteps the old
clamp since content is linearized by construction), tuplet fidelity in
the MusicXML writer (Verovio is strict about tuplet encoding — golden
tests first), and progress-file growth (cap session history, aggregate
forever-stats).
