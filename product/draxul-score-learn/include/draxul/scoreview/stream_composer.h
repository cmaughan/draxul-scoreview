// The composer (plans/scoreview-stream.md S3): decides what the endless
// stream feeds the player, one bar slot at a time, from the live player
// model — piece bars at a walking frontier, spaced REVIEW slices of weak
// bars, and fabricated DRILL bars built from the exact voiced chords the
// player fumbles. Pure and deterministic given its inputs; it extends a
// host-owned StreamProgram, and the host maps slots to windows and outcomes
// back through the program's provenance.
